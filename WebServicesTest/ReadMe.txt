Automated test have been defined and implemented for each of the following modules, and GET, POST and PUT methods have been written for:
- Posts
- Comments
- Users
- Albums

In a similar way, these tests can be implemented for photos, todos and db.
Also, these test can be enhanced by segregation of hard-coded data into a properties file.
All of the code has been run and tested successfully.
